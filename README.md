## Setting up a secure 1Password environment

If someone gains access to your 1Password vault file they can eventually crack it. It's simply a matter of time and compute power. While most of the time the effort required is probably not worth it for an attacker you should still ensure that your vault is as difficult to aquire as possible.

### 1.  Ensure that your data is stored with OPVault

Older vaults may be synced to DropBox in the Agile Keychain format. Ideally your vault should be synced with the newer, more secure, OPVault format.
