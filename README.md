## Setting up a secure 1Password environment

If someone gains access to your 1Password vault file they can eventually crack it. It's simply a matter of time and compute power. While most of the time the effort required is probably not worth it for an attacker you should still ensure that your vault is as difficult to aquire as possible.

The aim of this document is to provide a guide on how to store your 1Password vault securly while still minimising the risk that you will somehow lose access to it yourself.

### 1. Setup 1Password

#### 1a. Set a strong password that you can remember

### 2. Secure your DropBox

#### 2a. Set a strong password that you can remember

You want to be able to get into your DropBox even if you lose access to your 1Password vault elsewhere. 

#### 2b. Enable two factor authentication

#### 2c. Ensure that your data is stored with OPVault

If you already have 1Password synced to DropBox there's a chance it's stored in the Agile Keychain format. Ideally your vault should be synced with the newer, more secure, OPVault format. Follow the guide below to update it:

## Recovering access

### 1. Lost phone

### 2. Lost access to DropBox
